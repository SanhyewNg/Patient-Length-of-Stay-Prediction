# Patient-Length-of-Stay-Prediction

- Developed a machine learning model to predict patient length of stay (LOS) using Snowflake on AWS and Python. 
- Implemented end-to-end analytics, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with XGBoost and other regression techniques. 
- Built a retraining pipeline to monitor and address data and model drift, ensuring continuous improvement and accurate predictions for efficient hospital resource management.
